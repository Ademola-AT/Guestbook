// Watcher watches for updates on a variable and returns an updated Variable object if
// there are changes.  A Watcher object is associated with a variable upon construction.
//
// An application can have more than one Watcher, one for each variable.  It is typical
// to only have one Watcher per variable.
//
// A Watcher provider can dictate the type of Variable.Value if the backend service dictates
// a particular format and type.  If the backend service has the flexibility to store bytes and
// allow clients to dictate the format, it is better for a Watcher provider to allow users to
// dictate the type of Variable.Value and a decoding function.  The Watcher provider can use the
// runtimevar.Decoder to facilitate the decoding logic.

	// WatchVariable returns one of:
	//
	// 1. A new value for the variable in v, along with a provider-specific
	//    version that will be passed to the next WatchVariable call. wait is
	//    ignored and err must be nil.
	// 2. A new error. v, version, and wait are ignored.
	// 3. A nil v and version and err, indicating that the value of the variable
	//    or the error returned has not changed. WatchVariable will not be called
	//    again for wait.
	//
	// Implementations *may* block, but must return if ctx is Done. If the
	// variable has changed, then implementations *must* eventually return it.
	//
	// For example, an implementation that can detect changes in the underlying
	// variable could block until it detects a change (or until ctx is Done).
	// A polling implementation could poll on every call to WatchVariable,
	// returning nil v/version/err and a non-zero wait to set the poll interval
	// if there's no change.
	//
	// Version is provider-specific; for example, it could be an actual version
	// number, it could be the variable value, or it could be raw bytes for the
	// variable before decoding it.
	// TODO(issue #412): Consider refactoring to encapsulate State (including
	//                   prevVersion, prevErr), and "is the same as" checking)
