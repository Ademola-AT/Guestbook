      Tragedie of Macbeth*********************\\r\\n\\r\\n*****This file should be
      named 2264.txt or 2264.zip******\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg Etexts are usually
      created from multiple editions,\\r\\nall of which are in the Public Domain in
      the United States, unless a\\r\\ncopyright notice is included.  Therefore, we
      usually do NOT keep any\\r\\nof these books in compliance with any particular
      paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are now trying to release all our books one
      month in advance\\r\\nof the official release dates, leaving time for better
      editing.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note:  neither this list nor its contents are final
      till\\r\\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\\r\\nThe
      official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at\\r\\nMidnight, Central
      Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A\\r\\npreliminary version may often
      be posted for suggestion, comment\\r\\nand editing by those who wish to do so.
      \ To be sure you have an\\r\\nup to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please
      check file sizes\\r\\nin the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program
      has\\r\\na bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a\\r\\nlook
      at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a\\r\\nnew copy has
      at least one byte more or less.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation about Project Gutenberg
      (one page)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we
      work.  The\\r\\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\\r\\nto
      get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\\r\\nsearched
      and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\\r\\nprojected audience
      is one hundred million readers.  If our value\\r\\nper text is nominally estimated
      at one dollar then we produce $2\\r\\nmillion dollars per hour this year as
      we release thirty-six text\\r\\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999
      for a total of 2000+\\r\\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population,
      then the\\r\\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe
      Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\\r\\nFiles by December
      31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]\\r\\nThis is ten thousand titles
      each to one hundred million readers,\\r\\nwhich is only ~5% of the present number
      of computer users.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt our revised rates of production, we will reach
      only one-third\\r\\nof that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless
      we\\r\\nmanage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly\\r\\nfrom
      Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an\\r\\nassortment
      of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few\\r\\nmore years, so we
      are looking for something to replace it, as we\\r\\ndon't want Project Gutenberg
      to be so dependent on one person.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need your donations more than
      ever!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll donations should be made to \\\"Project Gutenberg/CMU\\\":
      and are\\r\\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = Carnegie-\\r\\nMellon
