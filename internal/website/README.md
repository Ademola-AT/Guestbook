Theme
-----

The theme used for this site is based on [hyde](https://github.com/spf13/hyde),
with several tweaks and modifications.

The license for the theme is at `themes/hyde/LICENSE.md`.

Use local hugo server for preview. `cd` into this directory and run:

```
$ hugo server -D
```

This will run the Hugo server that auto-updates its output based on the source
contents. It will print out the `localhost:<PORT>` URL to point the browser to.

This was tested with Hugo 0.53 but should work with subsequent versions as well.
