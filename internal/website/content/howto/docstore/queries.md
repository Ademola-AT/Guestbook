Docstore's `Get` action lets you retrieve a single document by its primary key.
Queries let you retrieve all documents that match some conditions.  You can also
use queries to delete or update all documents that match the conditions.

## Getting Documents

Like [action lists]({{< ref "actions.md#actions-and-action-lists" >}}), queries are built up in a fluent style.
Just as a `Get` action returns one document, the `Query.Get` method returns
several documents, in the form of an iterator. 

```go
iter := coll.Query().Where("Score", ">", 20).Get(ctx)
defer iter.Stop() // Always call Stop on an iterator.
```

Repeatedly calling `Next` on the iterator will return all the matching
documents. Like the `Get` action, `Next` will populate an empty document that
you pass to it:

```go
doc := &Player{}
err := iter.Next(ctx, doc)
```

The iteration is over when `Next` returns `io.EOF`.

You can pass a list of fields to `Get` to reduce the amount of data transmitted.

Queries support the following methods:

- `Where` describes a condition on a document. You can ask whether a field is
  equal to, greater than, or less than a value. The "not equals" comparison
  isn't supported, because it isn't portable across providers.
- `OrderBy` specifies the order of the resulting documents, by field and
  direction. For portability, you can specify at most one `OrderBy`, and its
  field must also be mentioned in a `Where` clause. 
- `Limit` limits the number of documents in the result.

If a query returns an error, the message may help you fix the problem. Some
features, like full table scans, have to be enabled via constructor options,
because they can be expensive. Other queries may require that you manually
create an index on the collection.

## Deleting Documents

Call `Delete` on a `Query` instead of `Get` to delete all the documents in the
collection that match the conditions.

## Updating Documents

Calling `Update` on a `Query` and passing in a set of modifications will update
all the documents that match the criteria.
