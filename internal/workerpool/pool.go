// Package workerpool provides a func called Run that allows doing work
// concurrently, only spawning goroutines as needed and not spawning more of
// them than a set limit. The idea for this package comes from Bryan C. Mills's
// talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zXAHh5tJqQ&t=33m13s
package workerpool

import (
	"context"
)

type Task func(context.Context)

// Run runs a worker pool with no more than limit goroutines. It repeatedly
// calls nextTask to get tasks to perform. These tasks are in the form of funcs
// that do some work via side effects. If nextTask returns nil, Run will no
// longer ask for more tasks, and will return after waiting for the running
// goroutines to finish. The provided context can be used to cancel everything
// and exit the loop.
func Run(ctx context.Context, limit int, nextTask func(context.Context) Task) {
	type token struct{}
	sem := make(chan token, limit)
Loop:
	for {

		select {
		case <-ctx.Done():
			break Loop
		case sem <- token{}:
		}
		go func() {
			doTask(ctx)
			<-sem
		}()
	}

	// Wait for the worker goroutines to finish. This means that if doWork
	// hangs then Run will hang. The benefit is that if doWork is
	// well-behaved then Run does not leak any goroutines.
