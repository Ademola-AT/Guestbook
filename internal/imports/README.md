# Import Redirects for Go Cloud

The packages in this repo have import paths beginning `gocloud.dev`. This works
because:

- The `gocloud.dev` domain redirects to the GitHub Pages servers. See the output of
  `dig gocloud.dev +noall +answer` and compare to the IP addresses [documented by
  GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/#configuring-a-records-with-your-dns-provider).

- This repo's settings configure its GitHub Page to display the contents of the
  `gh-pages` branch, with custom domain `gocloud.dev`. See "GitHub Pages" under
  the [settings](https://github.com/google/go-cloud/settings).

- Each package import path in this repo has a corresponding HTML page on the
  `gh-pages` branch that contains the `go-import` meta tag that `go get`
  expects. Those HTML pages are generated by the `makeimports.sh` script in this
  directory.

- The `makeimports.sh` script is invoked by Travis after a successful build when
  new changes are pushed to the `master` branch. This is configured in the
  project's [.travis.yml
  file](https://github.com/google/go-cloud/blob/master/.travis.yml). For details
  on GitHub Pages deployment with Travis see [this
  doc](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/).
