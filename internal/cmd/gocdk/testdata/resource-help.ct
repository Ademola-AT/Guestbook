$ gocdk help resource
gocdk uses Terraform to provision resources that can be used in your
application. Resources are associated with a specific biome; often, each biome
will use a different implementation of the resource. For example, your "dev"
biome may use a file-based implementation of "blob", while "prod" might use a
Cloud-based storage solution like a GCS bucket.

Usage:
  gocdk resource [command]

Available Commands:
  add         Add a resource to a biome
  list        List available resources

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for resource

Use "gocdk resource [command] --help" for more information about a command.
