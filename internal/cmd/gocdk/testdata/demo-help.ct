$ gocdk help demo
Demos consist of source code added to your application that demonstrate
the functionality of a particular Go CDK portable type.

By default, each demo uses a local implementation of the portable type; for
example, the "blob" demo uses an in-memory implementation of "blob".

If you want to use a different implementation of the portable type, you can
use the "gocdk resource" command to add it to your biome; for example,
"gocdk resource add blob/gcsblob" will provision a Google Compute Storage
bucket, and the "blob" demo will use it instead (with no code changes!).

Usage:
  gocdk demo [command]

Available Commands:
  add         Add a portable type demo
  list        List available portable type demos

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for demo

Use "gocdk demo [command] --help" for more information about a command.
