# Guestbook Sample

Guestbook is a sample application that records visitors' messages, displays a
cloud banner, and an administrative message. The main business logic is written
in a cloud-agnostic manner using MySQL, the generic blob API, and the generic
runtimevar API. All platform-specific code is set up by
[Wire](https://github.com/google/wire).

You can see how to build, run, and deploy this sample by following one of the
following tutorials based on the cloud platform of your choosing:

-  [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://gocloud.dev/tutorials/deploy-aws/)
-  [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://gocloud.dev/tutorials/deploy-gcp/)
